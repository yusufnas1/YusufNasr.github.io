									<h2 class="major">Data Analysis Project Using Python</h2>
									<p><strong>In my data analysis project, I leveraged Python to explore and analyze London bike ride data, uncovering valuable insights into urban mobility trends. By applying data cleaning, visualization, and statistical techniques, I delved into factors such as ride frequency, duration, and user patterns. This analysis not only revealed peak riding hours and popular routes but also provided insights into the city's transportation habits.</strong> (Be sure to click on each image to be taken to each individual project)</p>
